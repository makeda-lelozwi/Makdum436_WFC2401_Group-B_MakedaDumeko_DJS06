### DJS06 Project Brief: Higher Order Functions

#### Objective

In this challenge, I was tasked with manipulating data using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more, to perform a variety of tasks. 

#### Given Data Sets

1. A list of provinces:

```javascript
const provinces = [
  "Western Cape",
  "Gauteng",
  "Northern Cape",
  "Eastern Cape",
  "KwaZulu-Natal",
  "Free State",
];
```

2. A list of names:

```javascript
const names = [
  "Ashwin",
  "Sibongile",
  "Jan-Hendrik",
  "Sifso",
  "Shailen",
  "Frikkie",
];
```

3. A list of products with prices:

```javascript
const products = [
  { product: "banana", price: "2" },
  { product: "mango", price: 6 },
  { product: "potato", price: " " },
  { product: "avocado", price: "8" },
  { product: "coffee", price: 10 },
  { product: "tea", price: "" },
];
```

#### Exercises

1. **ForEach Basics**: Use `forEach` to log each name and each province to the console. Then, log each name with a matching province in the format "Name (Province)".
2. **Uppercase Transformation**: Use `map` to create a new array of province names in all uppercase. Log the new array to the console.
3. **Name Lengths**: Create a new array using `map` that contains the length of each name.
4. **Sorting**: Use `sort` to alphabetically sort the provinces.
5. **Filtering Cape**: Use `filter` to remove provinces containing "Cape". Log the count of remaining provinces.
6. **Finding 'S'**: Create a boolean array using `map` and `some` to determine if a name contains the letter 'S'.
7. **Creating Object Mapping**: Use `reduce` to transform the names array into an object mapping names to their respective provinces.

#### Advanced Exercises (Single `console.log` Execution)

For these exercises, wrap your logic in a single `console.log` statement:

1. **Log Products**: Iterate over the products array, logging each product name.
2. **Filter by Name Length**: Filter out products with names longer than 5 characters.
3. **Price Manipulation**: Filter out products without prices, convert string prices to numbers, and calculate the total price using `reduce`.
4. **Concatenate Product Names**: Use `reduce` to concatenate all product names into a single string.
5. **Find Extremes in Prices**: Identify the highest and lowest-priced items, returning a string formatted as "Highest: X. Lowest: Y."
6. **Object Transformation**: Using `Object.entries` and `reduce`, recreate the products object with keys 'name' and 'cost', maintaining their original values.
